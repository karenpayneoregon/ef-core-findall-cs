# About

This Visual Studio solution was originally for a Microsoft article [Entity Framework Core Find all by primary key (C#)](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/53841.entity-framework-core-find-all-by-primary-key-c.aspx).
Currently has a class and form project to demonstrate code for the above article along with two new projects to show simple editing a record using a newer version of Entity Framework Core and C#9.

:red_circle: Normally desktop application would not be used, instead unit test projects so that the code may be used in a desktop or web application. Since many developers avoid unit test this is the reason for desktop projects.
