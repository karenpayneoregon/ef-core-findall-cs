# About

Class project using an earlier version of `.NET Framework` and older version of `EF Core` to the project SampleLibrary. We will be using `EF Core 5`, `C#9` as in SampleLibraryCore.
The intent for this project is to find Categories by multiple primary keys. Note SampleLibraryCore has this functionality but it’s purpose is to show CRUD operations, in this case editing two properties of a record.
